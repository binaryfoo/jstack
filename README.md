Parse a thread dump from the /api/support endpoint of [go](https://github.com/gocd/gocd).

Last I looked was produced by [ThreadInformationProvider](https://github.com/gocd/gocd/blob/master/server/src/com/thoughtworks/go/server/service/support/ThreadInformationProvider.java).

Used hunting performance troubles.
